## Agenda

1. Talk about if it is worth to switch to Anaconda instead of Google CoLab
2. Explain what nested dictionaries are
3. Go over Machine learning tutorial I read

## Completed Work

1. I figured how to manipulate tuples and list and what the difference is
2. I read the Machine Learning tutorial in depth

## Questions

1. I tried to figure out how a nested dictionary works. I have some of what I tried saved that we can look at
2. I think I understand how to preprocess the data, I just have no idea how the machine learning function actually works

## To-Do

1. Switch to Anaconda as soon as I can
2. Once I get how nested dictionaries work, move on to do the python functions tutorial
3. Read the new tutorial I was shown that goes more in depth about how logisitc regression works
